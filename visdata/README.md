# `rubbl_visdata`

A preliminary effort at a generic interface for I/O on interferometric
visibility data. Pretty much a placeholder at this point.

See [the `rubbl_core` README on Crates.io][1] for a discussion of crate
duplication issues that may arise with key dependencies such as [`ndarray`][2].

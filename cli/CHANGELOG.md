# rc: micro bump

There are no code changes in this release of the Rubbl CLI. There are, however,
significant version bumps of the dependencies `anyhow`, `clap`, and `thiserror`.

Associated with this release is a new version of the `rubbl_casatables` crate,
which updates to casacore 3.5.0 and should add the ability to build on a wider
variety of platforms.

In tandem, the Rubbl crates have updated to [ndarray] 0.16 (#393, @pkgw). If
your code uses ndarray directly, you should make sure to update the version
requirement in your `Cargo.toml` files correspondingly.

Besides the above, the other crates in the Rubbl family have also received new
maintenance releases, but mostly don't contain comparably noteworthy changes.

The DOI of this release is [xx.xxxx/dev-build.rubbl.version][vdoi].

# rubbl 0.3.0 (2023-01-23)

This release of Rubbl adds automated DOI deposition to Zenodo (#230, @pkgw)!
This means that releases of the Rubbl suite are now formally published and
citable. Use `rubbl show version-doi` to print out the DOI of the Rubbl CLI tool
that youâ€™re using.

Other changes include:

- Start using the more modern `anyhow` and `thiserror` crates for error handling,
  rather than `failure` (#220, @cjordan).
- Clean up dependency specifications, and document them somewhat more clearly
  (#220, @cjordan, @pkgw).
- Update to the 4.x series of clap, when it's used (#198, @pkgw).

The DOI of this release is [10.5281/zenodo.7563020][vdoi].

# rc: minor bump

This release of Rubbl adds automated DOI deposition to Zenodo (#230, @pkgw)!
This means that releases of the Rubbl suite are now formally published and
citable. Use `rubbl show version-doi` to print out the DOI of the Rubbl CLI tool
that youâ€™re using.

Other changes include:

- Start using the more modern `anyhow` and `thiserror` crates for error handling,
  rather than `failure` (#220, @cjordan).
- Clean up dependency specifications, and document them somewhat more clearly
  (#220, @cjordan, @pkgw).
- Update to the 4.x series of clap, when it's used (#198, @pkgw).

The DOI of this release is [xx.xxxx/dev-build.rubbl.version][vdoi].

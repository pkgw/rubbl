# rc: minor bump

- Start using the more modern `anyhow` and `thiserror` crates for error
  handling, rather than `failure` (#220, @cjordan).
- Clean up dependency specifications, and document them somewhat more clearly
  (#220, @cjordan, @pkgw). 
- Update to the 4.x series of clap, when it's used (#198, @pkgw).
